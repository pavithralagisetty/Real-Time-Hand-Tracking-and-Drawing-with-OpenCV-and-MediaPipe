Real-Time Hand Landmark Tracking and Drawing with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This code utilizes the OpenCV computer vision library and the MediaPipe framework to track the movement of a single hand in real-time. It captures video from the camera and detects hand landmarks using the MediaPipe Hands module. The code enables drawing on a canvas by tracking the index finger movement. The color of the drawing can be switched between red and blue by pressing the 'c' key. The program terminates by pressing the 'q' key.
